Docker Compose Linter (**DCLint**) is a utility designed to analyze, validate and fix Docker Compose files. It helps
identify errors, style violations, and potential issues in Docker Compose files, ensuring your configurations are
robust, maintainable, and free from common pitfalls.

## Features

- **Error Detection**: Identifies syntax errors and common issues in Docker Compose files.
- **Style Enforcement**: Enforces best practices and style guidelines for maintainable configurations.
- **Flexible Integration**: Can be used locally, in Docker, or integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
- **Configurable Rules**: Customize the linter's behavior and rules according to your project's needs.
- **Auto-fixable Rules**: Some rules include an auto-fix mode, allowing you to automatically format and correct certain
  issues in your files.
- **Comments Support**: After automated sorting and fixing, comments remain in the correct place, ensuring no important
  information is lost during the formatting process.
- **Anchor Support:** Supports YAML anchors for shared configuration sections, with
  [some limitations](#anchor-handling).

## Getting Started

### Installation with Node.js

You can install Docker Compose Linter locally in your project or use it directly with npx.

> **Note:** DCLint requires Node.js version 18 or higher.

To install it locally:

```shell
npm install --save-dev dclint
```

### Running the Linter with npx

If you prefer not to install it globally, you can run the linter directly using npx:

```shell
npx dclint .
```

This command will lint your Docker Compose files in the current directory.

### Linting Specific Files and Directories

To lint a specific Docker Compose file or a directory containing such files, specify the path relative to your project
directory:

```shell
npx dclint /path/to/docker-compose.yml
```

To lint all Docker Compose files in a specific directory, use the path to the directory:

```shell
npx dclint /path/to/directory
```

In this case, `dclint` will search the specified directory for files matching the following pattern
`/^(docker-)?compose.*\.ya?ml$/`.

It will handle all matching files within the directory and, if [recursive search](./docs/cli.md#-r---recursive) is
enabled, also in any subdirectories.

Files and directories like `node_modules`, `.git,` or others specified in the exclusion list will be ignored.

### Display Help and Options

To display help and see all available options:

```shell
npx dclint -h
```

For more details about available options and formatters, please refer to the [CLI Reference](./docs/cli.md) and
[Formatters Reference](./docs/formatters.md).

## Usage with Docker

### Pull the Docker Image

First, pull the Docker image from the repository:

```shell
docker pull zavoloklom/dclint
```

### Run the Linter in Docker

To lint your Docker Compose files, use the following command. This command mounts your current working directory
`${PWD}` to the `/app` directory inside the container and runs the linter:

```shell
docker run -t --rm -v ${PWD}:/app zavoloklom/dclint .
```

### Linting Specific Files and Directories in Docker

If you want to lint a specific Docker Compose file or a directory containing such files, specify the path relative to
your project directory:

```shell
docker run -t --rm -v ${PWD}:/app zavoloklom/dclint /app/path/to/docker-compose.yml
```

```shell
docker run -t --rm -v ${PWD}:/app zavoloklom/dclint /app/path/to/directory
```

### Display Help in Docker

To display help and see all available options:

```shell
docker run -t --rm -v ${PWD}:/app zavoloklom/dclint -h
```

For more information about available options and formatters, please refer to the [CLI Reference](./docs/cli.md) and
[Formatters Reference](./docs/formatters.md).

## Usage as a Library

The `dclint` library can be integrated directly into your code, allowing you to run linting checks programmatically and
format the results as desired. Below are examples of how to use `dclint` as a library in both CommonJS and ES module
formats.

### Example with CommonJS

```javascript
const { DCLinter } = require('dclint');

(async () => {
  const linter = new DCLinter();

  const lintResults = await linter.lintFiles(['.'], true);
  const formattedResults = await linter.formatResults(lintResults, 'stylish');

  console.log(formattedResults);
})();
```

### Example with ES Module

```javascript
import { DCLinter } from 'dclint';

const linter = new DCLinter();

const lintResults = await linter.lintFiles(['.'], true);
const formattedResults = await linter.formatResults(lintResults, 'stylish');

console.log(formattedResults);
```

## Rules and Errors

Docker Compose Linter includes set of rules to ensure your Docker Compose files adhere to best practices. Detailed
documentation for each rule and the errors that can be detected by the linter is available here:

- [Rules Documentation](./docs/rules.md)
- [Errors Documentation](./docs/errors.md)

DCLint uses the [yaml](https://github.com/eemeli/yaml) library for linting and formatting Docker Compose files. This
ensures that any configuration files you check are compliant with YAML standards. Before any rule checks are applied,
two important validations are performed, which cannot be disabled - [YAML Validity Check](./docs/errors/invalid-yaml.md)
and [Docker Compose Schema Validation](./docs/errors/invalid-schema.md).

### Disabling Rules via Comments

You can disable specific linting rules or all rules in your Docker Compose files using comments. These comments can be
used either to disable rules for the entire file or for individual lines. For detailed instructions on how to use these
comments, check out the full documentation here: [Using Configuration Comments](./docs/configuration-comments.md).

### Anchor Handling

Docker Compose Linter provides support for YAML anchors specifically during schema validation, which enables the reuse
of configuration sections across different services for cleaner and more maintainable files.

However, note that anchors are neither validated by individual linting rules nor automatically fixed when using the
`--fix` flag.

When multiple anchors are required in a Docker Compose file, use the following syntax:

```yaml
x-anchor1: &anchor1
  ports:
    - 80
x-anchor2: &anchor2
  ports:
    - 81

services:
  image: image
  <<: [ *anchor1, *anchor2 ]
```

This approach, which combines anchors in a single << line, is preferable to defining each anchor on separate lines (
e.g., `<< : *anchor1` followed by `<< : *anchor2`).

More information on YAML merge syntax is available in the
[official YAML documentation](https://yaml.org/type/merge.html) and in
[known issue with Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/10411).

For an example of anchor usage, refer to the sample Compose file in `tests/mocks/docker-compose.anchors.yml`.

## Configuration

DCLint allows you to customize the set of rules used during linting to fit your project's specific needs. You can
configure which rules are applied, their severity levels, and additional behavior settings using a configuration file.

### Supported Configuration File Formats

DCLint supports flexible configuration options through the use of
[cosmiconfig](https://github.com/cosmiconfig/cosmiconfig). This means you can use various formats to configure the
linter, including JSON, YAML, and JavaScript files.

For example:

- `.dclintrc` (JSON, YAML, or JavaScript)
- `dclint.config.js` (JavaScript)
- A `dclint` key inside your `package.json`

### Example Configuration File

Here is an example of a configuration file using JSON format:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "no-version-field": 0,
    "require-quotes-in-ports": 1,
    "services-alphabetical-order": 2
  },
  "quiet": false,
  "debug": true,
  "exclude": [
    "tests"
  ]
}
```

- **rules**: Customize which rules to apply and their severity levels (`0` - Disabled, `1` - Warning, `2` - Error).
- **quiet**: Suppresses non-error output if set to `true`.
- **debug**: Enables debug mode with additional output if set to `true`.
- **exclude**: Specifies files or directories to exclude from linting.

### Configure Rules

In addition to enabling or disabling rules, some rules may support custom parameters to tailor them to your specific
needs. For example, the [require-quotes-in-ports](./docs/rules/require-quotes-in-ports-rule.md) rule allows you to
configure whether single or double quotes should be used around port numbers. You can configure it like this:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "require-quotes-in-ports": [
      2,
      {
        "quoteType": "double"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

In this example, the require-quotes-in-ports rule is enabled at the error level and configured to enforce double quotes
around ports.

## Integrate into CI/CD Pipeline

Automate linting as part of your CI/CD pipeline by adding the Docker run command to your pipeline script. This ensures
that your Docker Compose files are always checked for errors before deployment.

### GitLab CI Example

```yaml
lint-docker-compose:
  image:
    name: zavoloklom/dclint
    entrypoint: [ "" ]
  script:
    - /bin/dclint . -r -f codeclimate -o gl-codequality.json
  artifacts:
    reports:
      codequality: gl-codequality.json
```
