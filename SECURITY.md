## Security Best Practices

To help ensure the security of your usage of this project, we recommend the following:

- Always use the latest version of the software.
- Avoid using the `latest` tag when pulling images. Instead, specify exact versions.
- Regularly audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities.
- Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring access.

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

We follow a responsible disclosure policy to ensure that security vulnerabilities are handled appropriately. We ask that
you:

- Privately notify us of the issue before making any public disclosure.
- Allow a reasonable amount of time for us to address the vulnerability before you disclose it publicly.

We appreciate your contributions to making our project more secure. Thank you for working with us to protect the
community.
