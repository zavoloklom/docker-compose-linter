# Errors

These checks are mandatory and are always performed before the linter applies any rules.
This helps prevent scenarios where the linter attempts to analyze an incorrect or improperly structured file.

- [Invalid YAML Rule](./errors/invalid-yaml.md)
- [Invalid Schema Rule](./errors/invalid-schema.md)
