# Services Alphabetical Order Rule

Ensures that the services in the Docker Compose file are listed in alphabetical order. This rule helps maintain
consistency and readability in the configuration by enforcing a predictable order for services.

This rule is fixable. The linter can automatically reorder services in alphabetical order without altering their
internal structure or content.

## Problematic code example

```yml
services:
  d_service:
    image: image
  c_service:
    image: image
  b_service:
    image: image
  a_service:
    image: image
```

## Correct code example

```yml
services:
  a_service:
    image: image
  b_service:
    image: image
  c_service:
    image: image
  d_service:
    image: image
```

## Rule Details and Rationale

of services improves readability and maintainability, especially in larger projects. It allows team members to quickly
locate and manage services within the configuration file.

## Version
